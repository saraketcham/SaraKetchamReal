    <p>
      Social anxiety is the most common anxiety disorder, and yet, there aren’t many affordable or available professional methods of support. There also isn’t enough knowledge about its effects, and studies show that it has become more prevalent post-lockdown.</p>    </div>

        “Social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 1 out of 3 adolescents between 13 and 18 years old. Over 19 million people across America suffer from social anxiety disorder (SAD) today. It is the most common anxiety disorder and third most common mental health disorder in the country.” (Polaris Teen Center) 
        -> Statistics show that social anxiety affects a large population of adolescents.

        “In-person schooling has made isolating more difficult, but students’ anxiety about returning to classes could be more prevalent because of “social phobias” spawned by the pandemic, according to a study from The Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.” (From article on the New York Times)
        -> A professional peer-reviewed journal claims that the pandemic spurred more social phobias as students are integrated back into in-person schooling.

          Polaris Teen Center is a treatment center in LA that aims to support adolescents who struggle with mental health issues. The text the quote is from explains social anxiety and its treatments and symptoms, so because it has the purpose to share medical knowledge, it is not biased.

          The New York Times quote comes from an article titled How Young People’s Social Anxiety Has Worsened in the Pandemic by Eduardo Medina. The article argues that Covid had a negative effect on people’s social anxiety so it is biased in that regard. However, it has quotations that describe personal experiences from three or four people. It also includes quotes from studies and reliable sources.       </div>
